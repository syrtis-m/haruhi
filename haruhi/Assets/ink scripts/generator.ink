=== generator ===

~ pipes_toggle = getStoryVar("pipes_toggle")

~ endgame_power = getStoryVar("endgame_power")


you take a look at the generator.
{
- endgame_power:
    ->already_fixed
- generator_info:
    ->has_generator_info
- else:
    ->no_generator_info
}

= has_generator_info
oh yeah, that's an easy fix.
...
you were able to fix the generator. it should provide power to the converters now.
~ setStoryVar("pipes_toggle", true)
~ setStoryVar("endgame_power", true)
->check_end


= no_generator_info
yeaaahhhh, you don't think you can fix that without getting more info. maybe someone's computer will have a manual?

=already_fixed
the generator's working fine
